0:00:03.680,0:00:07.360
Okay I think we still have a few people 
logging in, but I think we're gonna go ahead

0:00:07.360,0:00:15.040
and get started. Just a little um a few notes for tonight, we are working with tech support

0:00:15.040,0:00:20.880
because we should have a discussion uh panel 
that will allow you to post questions during

0:00:20.880,0:00:26.480
our panel, um and also we have time for questions 
at the end before we do go into 101 chats.

0:00:26.480,0:00:31.200
So um we do have somebody from our team who's 
on with tech support so hopefully we'll get that

0:00:31.200,0:00:36.880
panel going soon. Once we do get that going just so 
you know any question that you post in the panel

0:00:36.880,0:00:42.240
um everyone will be able to see that that 
will be public so just be aware of that

0:00:42.240,0:00:49.440
as well, and then I'm also going to go ahead 
and try and share my screen. I'm at work so

0:00:49.440,0:01:04.320
I have two monitors so just give me 
one second to play around with that.

0:01:13.920,0:01:19.120
Okay can everyone see that okay? For my 
panelists can you give me a thumbs up if

0:01:19.120,0:01:22.640
you can see that, perfect, and at least for 
my panelists are you able to hear me okay?

0:01:23.360,0:01:27.920
Yes. Very good so we're gonna go ahead and get 
started I'll start by um introducing myself

0:01:27.920,0:01:32.720
my name is Jen Heinold I'm one of the assistant 
directors with Career and Professional Development,

0:01:32.720,0:01:39.280
one of my roles is to serve as liaison to the 
College of Science which is um kind of how this

0:01:39.280,0:01:44.720
event got started today and I will let um my other 
panelists introduce themselves uh Dr. Emori if you

0:01:44.720,0:01:50.320
want to go ahead? Hi my name is Meg Emori and I 
am the, one of the instructors in Principles of

0:01:50.320,0:01:54.560
Biology. I also teach the Careers in Biological 
Sciences course if you're interested in that.

0:01:56.880,0:02:00.480
Hi all my name is Annie Laib-Jenkins 
and I work as the assistant director

0:02:00.480,0:02:03.600
of Health Professions Advising within 
Career and Professional Development.

0:02:08.720,0:02:15.040
Awesome, so I am getting a note here from tech 
support if you all would give me one second um

0:02:17.120,0:02:21.520
eh we're gonna pause for just about 30 
seconds they should be able to refresh

0:02:21.520,0:02:26.960
our feed, and then we should be able to see 
our discussion panel. While they're doing that

0:02:26.960,0:02:35.360
um basically what what we're gonna do tonight 
is uh we are going to um really just talk about

0:02:36.960,0:02:43.920
ways to get involved, ways to be make yourself 
competitive for what it is that you want to do.

0:02:44.880,0:02:51.360
We know a lot of students just don't quite know 
how to get started, what should they be doing

0:02:51.360,0:02:55.920
um to be competitive. So that's what we're going 
to talk you through tonight. We're going to give

0:02:55.920,0:03:02.640
you some timelines as well on essentially um you 
know if you are applying for grad school, if you

0:03:02.640,0:03:05.840
are applying for health professions, we're going 
to go through some general timelines, but we're

0:03:05.840,0:03:10.960
also going to talk about gap years and things like 
that. And it does sound like everyone will need to

0:03:10.960,0:03:17.280
refresh for us to get our panel up so we can take 
your questions so let's go ahead and take a minute

0:03:17.280,0:03:22.480
if everyone will go ahead and refresh um their 
browsers. If you get kicked out just log back on

0:03:22.480,0:03:26.960
and then we'll go ahead and get started with our 
content. So we'll see everybody back here in just a

0:03:26.960,0:03:28.440
minute.

0:03:36.320,0:03:40.160
And it looks like I'm still going and 
we are recording, it looks like I got

0:03:40.160,0:03:44.240
everybody back and most importantly it 
looks like we have our discussion panel.

0:03:44.240,0:03:48.800
So very good um and then if my other 
panelists can help me moderate that

0:03:48.800,0:03:52.320
as I get going that would be great. I am 
going to go ahead and re-share my screen.

0:03:58.880,0:04:06.080
Okay very good, so the reason um one of the 
reasons we want to go ahead and go through

0:04:06.080,0:04:11.440
this is essentially if if students don't do 
anything during their time at Virginia Tech,

0:04:11.440,0:04:15.040
and unfortunately I've certainly had some of those 
appointments where students aren't very involved,

0:04:15.680,0:04:23.760
what happens is essentially the resume can look 
something like this if you just have your degree

0:04:24.800,0:04:29.520
this is all that's going to be on your resume. And 
we've definitely had students who for whatever

0:04:29.520,0:04:34.160
reason maybe they just didn't know what to do, um 
maybe because they didn't know what they want to

0:04:34.160,0:04:38.480
do, they didn't know what to get involved in, and so 
they kind of get that you know paralysis of oh I'm

0:04:38.480,0:04:43.520
just not going to do anything. So even if you're 
not sure the most important thing we hope you get

0:04:43.520,0:04:47.520
out of today is even if you're not sure what you want 
to do, if you have a general idea, if you have no

0:04:47.520,0:04:54.080
idea, um just start getting involved in something. 
um Because it's going to not only help you

0:04:54.080,0:04:59.840
explore but at least it's going to be something to 
get you going, to get you building your network, and

0:04:59.840,0:05:06.560
to get something going on your resume. One place 
you might want to start is discover this website

0:05:07.600,0:05:13.280
experience.vt.edu I haven't had a ton of time to 
play around with it. I'm actually doing a webinar

0:05:13.280,0:05:17.520
about it uh this Friday um so I wish it was last 
Friday because I would have known a little bit

0:05:17.520,0:05:21.040
more. But I played around with it a little bit 
and I do feel like they have some tools that can

0:05:21.040,0:05:27.280
be really helpful for students. um The my map to 
kind of help you maybe plan things out, um Clifton

0:05:27.280,0:05:31.600
Strengths if you haven't done your strengths is 
a great self-assessment tool to just learn more

0:05:31.600,0:05:36.960
about yourself and your strengths, um and that can 
be really helpful for students. The reflections

0:05:36.960,0:05:42.320
piece I I really think is helpful because 
sometimes what happens too is students do do a lot

0:05:42.320,0:05:46.720
of really good things, but they may be like wait 
and it's junior year and they're updating their

0:05:46.720,0:05:50.880
resume for the first time since freshman year, and 
they've done all this stuff but they really don't

0:05:50.880,0:05:57.040
remember much about it, and so now it becomes hard 
to really update that. So I would say maybe once

0:05:57.040,0:06:02.320
you know at the end of each semester, and even at 
the end of summer, take some time to update your

0:06:02.320,0:06:08.480
resume and really almost make a master resume out 
of it. um Write some reflections about what you did

0:06:08.480,0:06:14.320
if you had a really good team working experience 
right about that as it happens um because

0:06:14.320,0:06:18.480
as you get closer when you're doing interviews 
and stuff like that whether it's for an internship

0:06:18.480,0:06:24.000
for a graduate program you know for an actual job 
after graduation those are the types of questions

0:06:24.000,0:06:27.360
you're going to get in that situation, and those 
are things that you're going to write about in

0:06:27.360,0:06:32.080
your personal statement and your cover letter. So 
take two or three times a year and not only update

0:06:32.080,0:06:36.880
your resume, but do that reflections piece as 
well. So again if you're not sure what to do just

0:06:36.880,0:06:41.360
getting started I think experience.vt.edu 
can be a great place for you to start.

0:06:44.240,0:06:48.240
Jen just to pop in for a moment it looks 
as though at least one of our students is

0:06:48.240,0:06:53.200
having a challenge seeing your powerpoint, um 
I know I can see it okay but I just wanted to

0:06:53.200,0:06:57.200
let you know that that's happening in the 
discussion right now. Okay, is anyone else having

0:07:00.480,0:07:02.560
any issue go ahead and post that into

0:07:02.560,0:07:08.320
the discussion if anyone else 
is having a problem seeing it.

0:07:10.560,0:07:14.800
I will be sending out resources tomorrow to 
everybody that was registered for the event

0:07:14.800,0:07:20.400
tonight. So I can send a copy of the slides as well 
um I'm getting feedback from our tech support it

0:07:20.400,0:07:24.640
sounds like you should be able to see so you can 
always try refreshing um like you did before and

0:07:24.640,0:07:30.000
see if that helps, but thank you for letting us 
know. So what are some other ways to get experience?

0:07:30.000,0:07:34.400
And this is by no means an exhaust- exhaustive 
list but let's go ahead and go through this a

0:07:34.400,0:07:40.720
little bit so job shadowing can be a great way to 
um explore you know especially if you are trying

0:07:40.720,0:07:46.400
to determine a certain path to go down talking to 
actual professionals is one of the best things you

0:07:46.400,0:07:50.560
can do. Sometimes I think it's even more 
helpful than classes um to actually talk about

0:07:50.560,0:07:54.640
what do you do, what are your challenges, what do 
you love most about your job, what advice would

0:07:54.640,0:08:00.640
you give a student who's wanting to do this. um So 
talking to professionals whether it's you know an

0:08:00.640,0:08:04.960
actual job shadow, or just an informational 
interview can be so so helpful and Annie

0:08:04.960,0:08:08.800
will talk a little bit later, but especially for 
those that are interested in Health Professions

0:08:08.800,0:08:13.280
those clinical shadowing hours are going to 
be expected of you. um So just be aware of

0:08:13.280,0:08:18.880
that. Volunteering, obviously I think can be a 
great way to get involved and gain so many of

0:08:18.880,0:08:23.680
those personal skills that we know employers and 
graduate programs are looking for, that teamwork,

0:08:23.680,0:08:28.960
that leadership, those communication skills. um So 
sometimes I feel like students kind of downplay

0:08:29.600,0:08:35.120
volunteering and I think it's a wonderful way to 
explore and gain a lot of those skills as well.

0:08:36.320,0:08:42.480
Internships are pretty obvious um and yes they're 
definitely a good resume builder I see a lot of

0:08:42.480,0:08:46.800
internships from my juniors, right between junior 
and senior year. That's probably where we see them

0:08:46.800,0:08:52.720
the most. um We certainly do have some sophomores 
that are able to get internships, and occasionally

0:08:52.720,0:08:57.520
we do get freshmen. But I will say I've had a lot 
of appointments recently by freshmen who feel like

0:08:57.520,0:09:02.560
they're, it seems like they're expected to have, or 
they think they're expected to have an internship

0:09:02.560,0:09:06.480
and I can tell you an employer down the road is 
not going to expect you to have an internship

0:09:06.480,0:09:11.600
after freshman year. If you can get one, that's 
outstanding, but if you think about what an

0:09:11.600,0:09:17.040
internship is, it's really designed to be a very 
structured program where you are doing actual

0:09:17.040,0:09:22.640
work for that employer and in return that employer 
is giving you an experience to help educate you on

0:09:22.640,0:09:28.080
the field and you know build your resume and make 
you you know more prepared to enter that field.

0:09:28.080,0:09:34.000
So because of that you do have to have a certain 
background for most internships, um and most

0:09:34.000,0:09:37.920
freshmen just aren't going to have the coursework 
or the experience to be ready for some of those

0:09:37.920,0:09:43.040
experiences. Again there can be exceptions to that 
so I would never tell a freshman not to apply

0:09:43.040,0:09:48.000
but I also think it's important to be open-minded 
especially in our current job situation.

0:09:48.560,0:09:52.320
The economy is rebounding but it's going 
to take several years to really recover

0:09:52.320,0:09:56.880
from all that is probably for us to right to 
really recover from everything that has happened

0:09:56.880,0:10:01.760
over the last year not just the economy. So be 
open to all of these other opportunities as well.

0:10:02.720,0:10:08.160
And that takes me to general employment. I cannot 
tell you how many times we have students that

0:10:08.160,0:10:13.360
downplay their work experience. I just worked 
at the dining hall, I was only a lifeguard over

0:10:13.360,0:10:20.400
the summer, our office can help you think about and 
speak about and highlight all the wonderful skills

0:10:20.400,0:10:26.160
that you learned in that experience. So don't 
ever downplay employment. College is expensive,

0:10:26.160,0:10:30.880
um a lot of times students need to work to either 
help pay their bills, or for their spending money,

0:10:30.880,0:10:36.080
or whatever the case may be. um I met with a 
student earlier today they had to finance 75%

0:10:36.080,0:10:40.240
of her education. She had to work a lot, 
and so we talked about that on her resume

0:10:40.240,0:10:44.080
and all the different skills that she gained 
from that experience. So don't downplay

0:10:44.640,0:10:51.040
employment. Field study, we see this there are 
some majors on campus that have a field study

0:10:51.040,0:10:56.080
component that's built in as part of the degree 
requirement. It usually takes place takes place in

0:10:56.080,0:11:01.280
the senior year. So if you're thinking about 
a major that has a field study component, or

0:11:01.280,0:11:06.160
you're in a major that has a field study 
component I would say just be aware of that um

0:11:06.160,0:11:11.840
and think about what you want that experience 
to be, so that by the time you get there again

0:11:11.840,0:11:16.160
you're competitive you know for that experience 
because usually you do have to apply for that.

0:11:17.200,0:11:22.720
Service learning is another wonderful opportunity, 
now obviously we haven't done as much of this in

0:11:22.720,0:11:27.440
the last year as we have previously. Virginia 
Tech is really big on service learning

0:11:27.440,0:11:32.400
um this is a little challenging right now because 
it's hard for students to physically go into a lot

0:11:32.400,0:11:38.640
of spaces as we know, um but hopefully as we look 
forward to the next couple years we can get back

0:11:38.640,0:11:43.040
to some of these activities. And kind of tied 
to that there's another experience that's not

0:11:43.040,0:11:47.840
on this list that probably should be and that's 
study abroad. um There are some really cool short

0:11:47.840,0:11:53.480
term service learning study abroad trips that 
can be a wonderful experience. um Right now they

0:11:53.480,0:11:59.120
are approving study abroad on a case-by-case 
basis. But we do have about 50 Virginia Tech

0:11:59.120,0:12:04.160
students that are studying abroad this semester. 
So that is starting to open up a little bit and

0:12:04.160,0:12:08.480
again that can be another wonderful experience. 
um So if it's something you're thinking about

0:12:08.480,0:12:13.360
there are those short-term programs if you can't 
do a whole summer or semester, or obviously we

0:12:13.360,0:12:17.840
have those experiences as well. So make sure you 
get in touch with the global education office

0:12:17.840,0:12:21.360
if you have any thoughts of study abroad 
because the earlier you can plan the better.

0:12:22.560,0:12:28.560
And then obviously student organizations I I know 
this also looks different, um but one thing I love

0:12:28.560,0:12:33.840
about student organizations is um if you can get 
started early freshman or sophomore year then a

0:12:33.840,0:12:38.960
lot of times by junior senior year you can get 
into those leadership positions, which often look

0:12:38.960,0:12:44.480
so good on resumes. I also think this is a great 
way to find balance so I encourage students to

0:12:44.480,0:12:49.600
maybe get involved in one or two organizations 
that are going to be related to your career goals, to

0:12:49.600,0:12:55.520
your major so those resume builders, but find one 
or two that are just fun. I know you're not having

0:12:55.520,0:13:00.400
as much fun as honestly you probably should, I 
think having fun is important part of college. I

0:13:00.400,0:13:06.240
actually really do and I know that doesn't look 
the same as it has in the past, um but you know

0:13:06.240,0:13:11.280
joining one or two organizations to just meet your 
people to to just you know do something that you

0:13:11.280,0:13:16.320
enjoy that stress relief is so important as well 
and then you balance that out with the other ones.

0:13:16.320,0:13:22.880
And again if you're not sure where to start 
join one, right join one or two keep it small. um

0:13:23.760,0:13:27.760
That's totally fine don't jump in and join ten 
all of a sudden because time management's gonna

0:13:27.760,0:13:32.560
be really important as well um you can always add 
on more but if you're not sure just join one or

0:13:32.560,0:13:37.280
just you know you know look on Gobbler Connect and 
contact somebody. Be like hey can I just come to a

0:13:37.280,0:13:42.320
meeting and see what it's about? I know those are 
going to be virtual um but you know that's a great

0:13:42.320,0:13:48.000
way to build your resume too. And then the last 
thing I have on the list is research. If you're

0:13:48.000,0:13:53.280
thinking about um you know certainly this can be 
helpful for health professions, but definitely any

0:13:53.280,0:13:59.840
stem-based graduate program um I think research 
is is a key component to have on your resume. um

0:13:59.840,0:14:03.840
Also if you're interested in actually going into 
research of any kind we obviously have a lot of

0:14:03.840,0:14:08.160
science students who are thinking about that as 
a possible option, it can be so important. So I'm

0:14:08.160,0:14:12.080
going to go ahead and turn it over to Dr. Emori and 
she's going to talk about that a little bit more.

0:14:14.960,0:14:21.040
All right so if you're interested in getting 
involved on- in research on campus by far the best

0:14:21.040,0:14:26.480
resource for you is the Office of Undergraduate 
Research. So there's a website um they will have

0:14:26.480,0:14:30.720
resources to help you get into research, 
they highlight research opportunities,

0:14:30.720,0:14:34.720
if you're printing a poster and you're a student 
doing research they can help with that, they can

0:14:34.720,0:14:40.480
even help you with some travel funding. What I 
particularly want to highlight about this resource

0:14:40.480,0:14:44.240
is the student ambassadors. So these 
are students who have successfully

0:14:44.240,0:14:47.920
tried to get into research, gotten into 
research, they are doing research, um and

0:14:47.920,0:14:52.160
they're volunteering their time to help you 
with this process as well so you don't have to

0:14:52.160,0:14:56.640
sort of reinvent the wheel in terms of what am 
I supposed to do. Go ahead and turn the slide.

0:14:59.120,0:15:02.640
All right so I'm going to break down 
how to get into research in four steps.

0:15:03.200,0:15:07.840
So the first step is that you need to be a 
competitive applicant, so unfortunately we don't

0:15:07.840,0:15:12.880
have as many faculty as we do students on campus, 
and so ultimately there isn't research positions

0:15:12.880,0:15:18.480
available for every single student. So doing things 
like keeping up your GPA is really useful but

0:15:18.480,0:15:23.040
also thinking about getting into classes that will 
help pave the way to the research you want to do.

0:15:23.040,0:15:28.240
So if you're interested in an immunology lab it 
might make sense to take immunology. All right

0:15:28.240,0:15:34.800
next up- next click. All right so now (that) you're a 
competitive applicant how do you find faculty to

0:15:34.800,0:15:39.760
do research? So to do this I like to go on to the 
departmental websites. You can either look at the

0:15:39.760,0:15:44.880
faculty tab or the research tab, every department's 
a little different but what you're looking for

0:15:44.880,0:15:48.880
is a listing of faculty members. Usually 
it has a little picture of their face,

0:15:48.880,0:15:53.920
a link to their own lab website, and a little 
blurb about what they do. So this is by far

0:15:53.920,0:15:58.720
the fastest and efficien- most efficient way 
to sort of see who's doing what around campus.

0:15:59.520,0:16:03.440
And please don't limit yourself to your own 
department, there are computer scientists doing

0:16:03.440,0:16:09.280
research in physics, biologists doing research in 
chemistry, and so by no means do you need to keep

0:16:09.280,0:16:14.800
yourself just to your own department. Again. 
All right so now you have to reach out to

0:16:14.800,0:16:21.040
these faculty members. So in your email always 
include your name, how far you are along, why you're

0:16:21.040,0:16:25.520
interested in their lab, think about how much time 
do you have to offer, do you want to start this

0:16:25.520,0:16:30.240
semester, do you want to start next semester, do 
you have two hours, do you have five hours a week?

0:16:30.800,0:16:35.840
This will help them sort of gauge how you can fit 
into their lab, and again talk about any previous

0:16:35.840,0:16:40.560
lab experience you've had. If you've had immunology, 
if you're applying to immunology lab the things

0:16:40.560,0:16:45.840
that you have been doing to get ready for this 
opportunity now most of us faculty members are

0:16:45.840,0:16:50.880
a little bit swamped with email um so once you 
send out an email it's okay to wait a week or two

0:16:50.880,0:16:55.760
if you haven't heard from us please email again 
um that's respectful thing you're not bothering

0:16:55.760,0:17:00.800
us if after two emails you haven't heard then 
it's probably a bad semester things are just a

0:17:00.800,0:17:05.520
little crazy um and reach out again maybe next 
semester if you really want to be in that lab

0:17:06.160,0:17:11.520
the last thing i will say on this is be mindful 
that we as faculty even though we're all working

0:17:11.520,0:17:17.120
from home mostly now we still talk to each other 
um and so try not to email every single professor

0:17:17.120,0:17:22.880
in an entire department at once because that makes 
us feel like you just want a live body and that

0:17:22.880,0:17:27.680
makes us much less interested in you as a student 
right whereas if you email two or three at a time

0:17:27.680,0:17:31.920
then we think oh you really are interested in 
what research we are doing so i would say two

0:17:31.920,0:17:36.480
to three at a time and then just keep moving down 
that list depending on again we're in covid not

0:17:36.480,0:17:43.040
all labs are working at full steam yet so there 
you go and last one last thing i want to say is

0:17:43.600,0:17:49.280
you can do research as a study abroad opportunity 
so there are research opportunities across the us

0:17:49.280,0:17:55.200
great for summer research when i was an undergrad 
i did research in germany so you can even do your

0:17:55.200,0:18:06.320
study abroad as a research experience and that's 
a wonderful opportunity too all right back to you

0:18:07.040,0:18:12.320
very much for covering that so i also want to 
just talk about our office a little bit and all

0:18:12.320,0:18:16.880
the ways that we can help you so even from the 
very beginning if you're just i don't know what

0:18:16.880,0:18:22.400
i want to do i'm not sure major wise career-wise 
any of that we have lots of resources to help you

0:18:22.400,0:18:29.920
in addition to our staff we have self-assessments 
um we can help walk you through um you know

0:18:31.280,0:18:36.000
walk you through okay that every major 
and career it's not always linear

0:18:36.000,0:18:40.640
um and so we can kind of talk through that process 
oftentimes i think thinking about career first

0:18:40.640,0:18:45.120
and then backtracking to majors actually makes 
more sense because the majority of careers you

0:18:45.120,0:18:51.120
can do with a variety of majors occasionally there 
is a linear path certain things like to sit for a

0:18:51.120,0:18:55.440
cpa you do have to have certain accounting classes 
which means at some point you're probably going to

0:18:55.440,0:19:00.720
complete an accounting program right that does 
exist for sure but the vast majority of careers

0:19:00.720,0:19:05.360
you can do with any major so we can kind of help 
you navigate that because it can be overwhelming

0:19:05.920,0:19:10.160
um we're happy to talk to you again about certain 
qualifications and things like that that might

0:19:10.160,0:19:14.480
make sense or make you more competitive for 
certain careers or certain uh graduate programs

0:19:14.480,0:19:18.880
as well as annie will talk about we're here 
for all everything health professions so it

0:19:18.880,0:19:22.000
doesn't matter what health professions 
you're thinking about or interested in

0:19:22.000,0:19:26.720
the sooner you connect with the house health 
professions team here at uh career impression

0:19:26.720,0:19:34.400
development the better because it is they are all 
unique in their own way um in terms of process um

0:19:34.400,0:19:39.760
and they can definitely help you navigate that and 
and be as competitive as an applicant as possible

0:19:40.800,0:19:45.520
we do a lot of resume and cover letter reviews 
and right now we are doing a ton of resume reviews

0:19:45.520,0:19:50.160
um so you know i've been talking about resumes a 
lot and you know getting experience so you have

0:19:50.160,0:19:54.560
something to talk about but a lot of students 
don't even know really how to format a resume

0:19:54.560,0:20:00.000
there's some bad templates out there i'm going to 
be honest with you um so definitely take advantage

0:20:00.000,0:20:04.880
of our office we can help you with that a lot of 
students don't realize in terms of employment a

0:20:04.880,0:20:09.840
lot of employers use tracking systems so it's 
not even a person that's looking at your resume

0:20:09.840,0:20:13.120
and there are certain things you're going to need 
to do to make sure you can make it through those

0:20:13.120,0:20:18.400
systems so we're more than happy to help you with 
your resume and your cover letter we also a lot of

0:20:18.400,0:20:22.560
students don't even know where to start in terms 
of searching okay i think i want an internship in

0:20:22.560,0:20:27.600
in area x but i don't know where to start let us 
help you walk through that process because there's

0:20:27.600,0:20:33.120
a lot of job search engines and a lot of resources 
out there that can be valuable and helpful but you

0:20:33.120,0:20:38.000
can end up spending four hours one day just going 
down the rabbit hole and have nothing to show for

0:20:38.000,0:20:42.480
it so you know we're here to help you go through 
that process as well i'm going to talk a little

0:20:42.480,0:20:46.560
bit about graduate school tonight and planning 
for that and that's another area where we can help

0:20:47.360,0:20:51.520
and then let's say you get to a point where you 
actually get an interview we can do a practice

0:20:51.520,0:20:55.200
interviews with you we have a lot of students that 
will do practice interviews with us and that can

0:20:55.200,0:21:00.000
be so so helpful especially on how to navigate 
that behavioral interview and how to best talk

0:21:00.000,0:21:05.120
about your experiences and then finally if you're 
in a situation where you actually have an offer

0:21:05.120,0:21:11.520
first of all yay that's amazing um we can talk to 
you about negotiations are you able to negotiate

0:21:11.520,0:21:16.320
that offer what are you able to negotiate if 
you're fortunate enough to have more than one

0:21:16.320,0:21:21.840
offer what should you be considering to make that 
decision so this is just an example of all the

0:21:21.840,0:21:27.600
ways our office is here to help this is a picture 
of our main website so if you click on that career

0:21:27.600,0:21:32.400
resources and advising for students it's going to 
take you to a list that's basically going to go

0:21:32.400,0:21:37.280
through a lot of the things i talked about and 
resources associated with those to schedule an

0:21:37.280,0:21:41.840
appointment with our office you're going to want 
to go to our website and actually go to handshake

0:21:41.840,0:21:46.160
handshake is a wonderful platform so you're 
going to want to set up an account it's free

0:21:46.160,0:21:50.560
you should do that so you can schedule with 
us you can obviously find events like the one

0:21:50.560,0:21:55.120
that you're doing tonight along with a lot of 
other info sessions we have a lot of employers

0:21:55.120,0:22:00.640
that are posting information sessions right now um 
health professions does a ton of events and even

0:22:00.640,0:22:05.760
jobs whether it's a local you know part-time 
campus part-time job internship opportunity

0:22:05.760,0:22:10.320
full-time jobs those all get posted on handshake 
as well so definitely spend some time with that

0:22:11.280,0:22:15.280
and then you know when i talk about networking 
again if you go to our website you can also go

0:22:15.280,0:22:20.640
to hokey mentorship connect that is our alumni 
mentoring platform so when i talk about reaching

0:22:20.640,0:22:24.960
out to alumni reaching out to people that are in 
these various fields that you're interested in

0:22:24.960,0:22:30.320
um definitely take advantage of hokie mentorship 
connect we have over a thousand alumni on there

0:22:30.320,0:22:34.800
that want to help students they were students 
they know what this process is like they know

0:22:34.800,0:22:39.520
how overwhelming it can be so certainly you 
know make sure you check that out as well

0:22:40.960,0:22:46.320
and now we're going to kind of switch gears a 
little bit and we are going to start talking about

0:22:46.320,0:22:51.520
grad school so grad school can be a wonderful 
experience all of us on the panel have been

0:22:51.520,0:22:57.120
through grad school um what grad school is not is 
it's probably not a good place to find yourself

0:22:57.120,0:23:01.920
it's a very expensive and trying time to do that 
or at least it can be so when you're thinking

0:23:01.920,0:23:07.840
about grad school i think it's important to first 
of all have at least some direction i don't think

0:23:07.840,0:23:12.240
you have to have like that that first career and 
i do say first because you're probably gonna have

0:23:12.240,0:23:17.200
many careers um i don't think you need to have 
like it pinpointed exactly but i do think it's

0:23:17.200,0:23:22.000
helpful to have a general direction before you 
commit to a graduate program i definitely think

0:23:22.000,0:23:26.640
um that's certainly helpful um you're 
not going to be taking gen eds you're

0:23:26.640,0:23:30.720
not going to be taking electives and if you 
are they're going to be tied to your program

0:23:30.720,0:23:34.320
so put some thought into that i know sometimes 
we have students that are like well maybe the

0:23:34.320,0:23:38.880
job market's down and i'll go to grad school i 
know dr emery did that but she went to harvard

0:23:38.880,0:23:43.680
and had funding so that's a little bit of a 
different situation um especially if you've taken

0:23:43.680,0:23:48.880
on a lot if you already have a lot of loans after 
undergrad i know i had loans after undergrad um

0:23:49.440,0:23:53.520
you just want to really put a lot of thought 
into it before you take on more debt especially

0:23:54.080,0:23:59.120
heading into a graduate program i get very mama 
bear about that but it can be very expensive

0:23:59.120,0:24:03.120
the next thing you want to look at is are you 
competitive for admission so once you kind of

0:24:03.120,0:24:07.600
have that general direction of what you want to 
do you're going to start looking at programs when

0:24:07.600,0:24:12.000
you're looking at programs you really want to do 
as much research on those websites to find out

0:24:12.000,0:24:18.160
what do i need to be competitive and then do some 
some reflection and be honest with yourself am i

0:24:18.160,0:24:22.880
there and if not what do i need to do to get there 
and again that's where you know everyone here

0:24:22.880,0:24:27.840
you know is happy to help you with that um but 
definitely you know want to look into that as well

0:24:29.840,0:24:35.600
next thing i talked about you know financing 
um can you afford it finance it or get funding

0:24:35.600,0:24:38.960
so um as i mentioned i'm going 
to be sending out resources

0:24:38.960,0:24:43.680
um to everyone that registered tonight one of 
those resources is going to be handout on funding

0:24:43.680,0:24:49.200
it is especially it is geared especially more 
towards uh stem fields because we do know right

0:24:49.200,0:24:52.800
now there tends to be more funding available 
for stem fields but it's going to go through

0:24:52.800,0:24:59.360
the different opportunities for funding kind of 
based on um based on lots of different things so

0:24:59.360,0:25:04.560
there's going to be a lot of links on there for 
you um but as i mentioned i think it's important

0:25:04.560,0:25:10.160
to think about that especially before you take on 
additional debt and there's lots of ways you can

0:25:10.160,0:25:15.120
get funding as well so you will be getting that 
later um it's hard to go in a lot of the specifics

0:25:15.120,0:25:20.320
in the time we have tonight but i just wanted you 
to know that that's going to be coming for you

0:25:21.680,0:25:28.400
so the next thing is can you handle the workload 
um graduate school i think most people would tell

0:25:28.400,0:25:32.080
you for the most part every program is a little 
bit different and there's so many different

0:25:32.080,0:25:36.080
programs out there right now but it's typically 
more challenging and there's going to be more

0:25:36.080,0:25:40.240
expected of you than undergrad that's going to 
be especially true for health professions zany's

0:25:40.240,0:25:44.080
going to address but especially for those that 
are leading towards you know a master's degree

0:25:44.080,0:25:51.520
or a phd in a stem field i feel like that um 
you know can be it's going to be challenging

0:25:51.520,0:25:56.080
uh before i start working at virginia tech i 
worked at the university of illinois for about

0:25:56.080,0:26:00.560
11 years and i was in general studies for five 
years of that as an academic advisor so i had a

0:26:00.560,0:26:04.320
lot worked with a lot of students that came into 
college thinking i'm going to go to med school

0:26:04.960,0:26:09.680
and they'd start taking some of those classes and 
i had a lot of appointments where students would

0:26:09.680,0:26:15.120
say well if i just get through this then i'm gonna 
go to med school and i try to do it in a funny way

0:26:15.120,0:26:20.000
but i had to have some real conversations along 
the lines of here's the thing med school makes

0:26:20.000,0:26:25.440
undergrad look like preschool so if you're not 
getting through this you're not gonna get through

0:26:26.400,0:26:32.640
med school right and i don't say that to be mean 
but you know that was the mentality and so just

0:26:32.640,0:26:38.320
be aware there's gonna be a lot expected of you 
um but again it's it's a wonderful opportunity

0:26:38.320,0:26:43.040
i you will learn more than you ever will 
but if you need a break we're going to talk

0:26:43.040,0:26:46.320
about a gap year so that's something else 
to keep in mind too if you're like i want

0:26:46.320,0:26:50.400
to do it but i really need a break that's an 
option as well so we'll talk about that too

0:26:51.600,0:26:56.720
and then lastly when you start doing all this 
research and you have kind of that direction

0:26:56.720,0:27:00.800
right so you want to kind of have that that 
career direction to go into start looking

0:27:01.520,0:27:06.720
at what those jobs look what is the job market 
like and will going to grad school actually make

0:27:06.720,0:27:12.800
you more marketable for a lot of professions 
um the answer is going to be yes but not always

0:27:12.800,0:27:16.960
depending on what you want to do you might be 
more competitive or better off just going into

0:27:16.960,0:27:23.600
the workforce and getting actual experience before 
um as you know as opposed to going to grad school

0:27:23.600,0:27:27.280
and the other thing when you think of all this and 
especially think of the financing the money too

0:27:27.280,0:27:33.360
even if you are funded which is awesome um you're 
not really making money most funding is enough to

0:27:33.360,0:27:37.920
cover your living expenses while you're there 
but it's not the same as bringing home like an

0:27:37.920,0:27:43.360
actual salary during that time so if it is like 
a health professions or phd program that that's

0:27:43.360,0:27:48.960
going to go on for several years you definitely 
want to just factor that in as well so again i'll

0:27:48.960,0:27:53.360
be giving you that other resource but i feel like 
these are the main considerations to think about

0:27:53.360,0:27:56.880
if you're deciding whether or not to do grad 
school or at least do grad school right away

0:27:59.040,0:28:04.080
so this is a very general timeline i don't want 
you to think you're stuck on this but this is

0:28:04.080,0:28:10.640
just to give you an idea for a student who would 
be starting a stem-based program um immediately

0:28:10.640,0:28:18.000
after uh graduating um you know their undergrad 
here at tech so freshman year typically and and

0:28:18.000,0:28:21.760
again i'll send out copies of the slides so 
you have them so if you can't see this 100

0:28:21.760,0:28:25.840
clearly um if you make your screen full screen 
if you haven't done that yet it might help but

0:28:25.840,0:28:30.480
you want to establish a good gpa but i'm going to 
talk about how it's okay if you had a rough year

0:28:30.480,0:28:35.680
um really start exploring get any experience you 
can we talked about just join that one club just

0:28:35.680,0:28:42.160
start doing something is better than nothing and 
then you may to stay on track it may be easier

0:28:42.160,0:28:45.920
if you start taking prereqs your freshman year 
obviously if you're still exploring sometimes you

0:28:45.920,0:28:50.000
may be doing a little bit of ketchup on those 
and that's okay so the other thing i'll say

0:28:50.000,0:28:55.120
about gpa is we do know a lot of freshmen um don't 
always have the best freshman year college is hard

0:28:55.120,0:29:00.480
it's an adjustment and especially in this virtual 
world it's an adjustment um i personally know

0:29:00.480,0:29:06.640
people that have law degrees and phds that were on 
probation after their freshman year of college so

0:29:06.640,0:29:17.440
you're using resources and you have a plan on how 
to recover but again i personally have worked with

0:29:17.440,0:29:23.120
people who have gone on to really great graduate 
programs after not having a great freshman year

0:29:23.680,0:29:27.600
but they were able to come back and their programs 
were able to see that upward trend so just be

0:29:27.600,0:29:32.080
aware of that sophomore year obviously you want 
to try and either bring up or maintain a gpa

0:29:32.080,0:29:35.840
if you can start getting involved in research 
that's great if not definitely need to do it by

0:29:35.840,0:29:40.960
junior year um volunteering and then probably 
you know definitely getting started on prereqs

0:29:42.080,0:29:46.720
junior year pretty much working on the gpa getting 
involved in research volunteering or getting

0:29:46.720,0:29:51.360
involved you know in other ways um and then 
you need to start researching your programs for

0:29:51.360,0:29:56.560
sure at this point if you haven't already um and 
then we get to summer before senior year now in

0:29:56.560,0:30:01.760
a pre-covered world you would have to be studying 
for and taking a gre or some type of entrance exam

0:30:02.480,0:30:06.400
i don't know what's going to happen with these 
moving forward i know a lot of programs have

0:30:06.400,0:30:12.560
waived these for this year because of covid and 
not being able to have access across the board  
0:30:10.160,1193:02:47.295
you can recover you just want to make sure that 
you're working hard with your academic advisor

0:30:12.560,0:30:18.000
um you know for these exams but some of them are 
going to require them again some of them might not

0:30:18.000,0:30:22.640
i don't know what's going to happen so this is 
where doing that program research is so important

0:30:22.640,0:30:27.040
on because they you may have programs that 
require it you may have some other optional

0:30:27.040,0:30:30.720
and you may have some where they don't and then 
typically again if you're going to go right

0:30:30.720,0:30:36.080
after senior year fall senior year getting 
all your stuff together um if you have to

0:30:36.080,0:30:41.040
retake your exam start working on your personal 
statement is so important that reflection piece

0:30:41.040,0:30:46.240
so you have stuff to talk about and then with 
recommendation letters please don't i know dr

0:30:46.240,0:30:53.360
emory don't spring those on them the last minute 
um give them time give them a copy of your resume

0:30:53.360,0:30:58.560
but throughout these other years be building 
those relationships that's the important thing um

0:30:58.560,0:31:01.600
you know just because you got an a in somebody's 
class doesn't mean they know you well enough to

0:31:01.600,0:31:07.520
write a really strong personal letter so i know 
virtual office hours are not as fun and easy as

0:31:08.400,0:31:12.720
um you know in person office hours but make sure 
that you are still building those relationships

0:31:12.720,0:31:17.840
so you have people that can write you really 
strong letters and then finally you would finalize

0:31:17.840,0:31:23.840
everything typically december again can vary by 
program um april 15th is your decision deadline

0:31:23.840,0:31:29.040
and then most programs start july or august 
um but what you don't see in here and i know

0:31:29.040,0:31:34.640
annie's gonna agree with me on this is i don't 
see a lot of sleep and i don't see a lot of fun

0:31:34.640,0:31:40.800
um so guess what you can do a gap year um they're 
more and more common they're more and more popular

0:31:40.800,0:31:45.440
it gives you an extra year to do all the things i 
just talked about in three years it gives you four

0:31:45.440,0:31:51.360
years to do that there are some wonderful like 
opportunities during one or more gap years there

0:31:51.360,0:31:56.080
are some post baccalaureate opportunities that 
are pretty research oriented but they're that's

0:31:56.080,0:32:00.640
a wonderful opportunity they are competitive 
but that's a great thing to do in a gap year

0:32:00.640,0:32:05.120
there are just other cool programs that are you 
know a couple years things like americorps things

0:32:05.120,0:32:10.160
like the peace corps but you can also just get 
a job a lot of students don't realize that they

0:32:10.160,0:32:16.800
think that first job is is this major commitment 
right now pre-covered on average time students

0:32:16.800,0:32:22.400
were spending in their first job after graduation 
is about 14 months so it is not uncommon to only

0:32:22.400,0:32:27.200
stay in that first position for a year or two so 
that is another opportunity for you as well and

0:32:27.200,0:32:32.080
i feel like a lot of students don't necessarily 
realize that um so all of us on the panel we're

0:32:32.080,0:32:38.480
big fans of gap years um and we are happy to kind 
of talk you through what should i do what can i do

0:32:38.480,0:32:42.320
but if you need more time to be sure to be 
ready and be competitive this is you know

0:32:42.320,0:32:47.040
one or more gap years is a wonderful opportunity 
and we really encourage that and with that i'm

0:32:47.040,0:32:51.440
going to pass it along to annie who's going to 
specifically talk about um the preparation for

0:32:51.440,0:32:57.920
health professions programs excellent thank you 
so much jen so yes everything that jen said about

0:32:57.920,0:33:03.680
gap years i will reiterate tenfold so i'm going to 
talk a little bit about the timeline into health

0:33:03.680,0:33:09.440
professions for those of you that are interested 
in med school dental school vet school ptot or

0:33:09.440,0:33:14.400
anything in between that's pre-health that's 
what we're here for so the first thing if you

0:33:14.400,0:33:18.720
take nothing else away from this conversation 
is that i want you to remember that if you are

0:33:18.720,0:33:23.920
pre-health it is a marathon not a sprint so 
what i mean by that is that the application

0:33:23.920,0:33:28.880
cycle from the time you apply to the time that 
you would start a health professional program

0:33:28.880,0:33:35.040
it's typically just about a year and many students 
take many years leading up to that application

0:33:35.040,0:33:39.840
to build the experience and the competencies that 
they need to develop to be a competitive applicant

0:33:39.840,0:33:43.360
so i want you to keep in mind it's a marathon 
not a sprint so let's talk about what you can

0:33:43.360,0:33:48.640
do to get started so i think it probably goes 
without saying that academics are important if

0:33:48.640,0:33:53.200
you're interested in a health profession they're 
necessary they're not sufficient but it is a

0:33:53.200,0:33:58.160
necessary thing that we need to consider to have 
a strong academic record professional schools

0:33:58.160,0:34:02.640
are going to be asking hey if we admit this 
student do we have faith that that student can

0:34:02.640,0:34:08.000
be successful when they get into the program and 
your undergraduate record is your best proxy to

0:34:08.000,0:34:12.400
convince them that yes they should have faith in 
your ability to be successful and then we've got

0:34:12.400,0:34:17.280
two sub questions underneath that number one is 
can you handle a science curriculum right so that

0:34:17.280,0:34:21.520
means being successful in your course work namely 
your science coursework in particular but really

0:34:21.520,0:34:27.760
overall and then question number two is okay but 
can you handle the academic rigor so jen mentioned

0:34:27.760,0:34:32.080
this earlier but professional school doesn't 
look like undergrad undergrad i lovingly call

0:34:32.080,0:34:36.720
the swiss cheese schedule you all have a class 
and then nap time and then a class and then you

0:34:36.720,0:34:41.040
get to go get a snack and then a class and then 
maybe you study a little bit and rinse and repeat

0:34:41.040,0:34:45.040
that monday through friday professional school 
isn't really like that they put you in class from

0:34:45.040,0:34:48.960
the morning until the evening monday through 
friday and then they send you home to study

0:34:48.960,0:34:53.520
so they want to make sure that students can handle 
academic intensity so as we think about this the

0:34:53.520,0:34:58.560
first thing that you want to be doing is starting 
as strong as you possibly can like jen said

0:34:58.560,0:35:03.680
academic recovery is possible but it's a whole lot 
easier to start strong than have to dig yourself

0:35:03.680,0:35:08.640
out of a hole later so we can discuss that but you 
want to make sure that you get your footing and

0:35:08.640,0:35:14.000
that you feel really good academically first once 
you feel like you've got your feet underneath you

0:35:14.000,0:35:19.600
if you can handle taking 15 plus credits per 
term and you're a pre-health student that's a

0:35:19.600,0:35:24.160
general recommendation of the pre-health office 
just so that you can demonstrate your ability to

0:35:24.160,0:35:30.320
handle academic rigor so on top of that as you get 
started please seek out advising every one of you

0:35:30.320,0:35:35.040
has an academic advisor and if you're a pre-health 
student you've got three full-time staff members

0:35:35.040,0:35:40.240
that specifically work with pre-health students to 
help them on their journey to a health profession

0:35:40.240,0:35:44.800
so please utilize us our office is called health 
professions advising we're nested within career

0:35:44.800,0:35:48.880
and professional development we encourage the 
students meet with us at least once a year but

0:35:48.880,0:35:53.200
if you're on a truncated timeline like let's say 
you're a transfer student or you're graduating

0:35:53.200,0:35:59.200
early even more often than that would be ideal 
the next thing is join the hpa hub on canvas

0:35:59.200,0:36:04.000
so what this is it's a canvas page where we can 
send announcements opportunities and events to you

0:36:04.000,0:36:09.440
as pre-health students and it's also a repository 
of resources that may be useful to you you can

0:36:09.440,0:36:16.240
join it from our website so the career services 
website is career.vt.edu and then add a forward

0:36:16.240,0:36:21.200
slash hpa and you'll get to the webpage of career 
professional development that's specifically

0:36:21.200,0:36:25.120
for health professions advising and at the top 
right of that you can click join the hpa hub

0:36:25.120,0:36:29.920
on canvas and we will get you added so i would 
strongly encourage you to do that okay so now

0:36:29.920,0:36:33.680
we want to talk about engagement you've got your 
feet underneath you academically you're on the

0:36:33.680,0:36:39.120
hub you know where your advisor is we want to talk 
about what you need to do to become competitive so

0:36:39.120,0:36:44.880
the first thing that i want to say here is that it 
sounds a little bit like a checklist but you can't

0:36:44.880,0:36:50.160
treat it like a checklist okay as i start talking 
about experiences what i want you to think about

0:36:50.160,0:36:54.240
is that professional schools are looking for 
interesting people so if you're following your

0:36:54.240,0:36:59.040
intrinsic motivations as you gain some of these 
foundational experiences you're doing it the right

0:36:59.040,0:37:03.360
way if you're treating it like a checklist that 
you have to check the boxes on you're doing it

0:37:03.360,0:37:08.720
the wrong way so we want to think about that but 
it's really important to get clinical experiences

0:37:08.720,0:37:12.480
so professional programs first they're gonna 
wonder does this student actually know what

0:37:12.480,0:37:16.240
they're getting into right if you tell me you're a 
pre-med student and you're applying to med school

0:37:16.240,0:37:21.360
but you've never ever interacted with a doctor or 
gone to a hospital to shadow doctors how should

0:37:21.360,0:37:26.000
i believe you right so you want to make sure that 
you're having observational experiences that will

0:37:26.000,0:37:30.320
be able to answer that question then our other 
question that professional schools are going

0:37:30.320,0:37:34.560
to want to know is is this person going to be 
good at working with patients do they want to

0:37:34.560,0:37:39.360
work with sick people are they excited about 
that right so to answer that question you want

0:37:39.360,0:37:45.280
to be gaining direct patient care experience so 
emt experience certified nursing aid experience

0:37:45.280,0:37:51.840
a hospice volunteer medical assistant those sorts 
of roles that can put you in contact with patients

0:37:51.840,0:37:55.600
and teach you do you really want to work 
with patients and then provide evidence to

0:37:55.600,0:38:00.720
an admissions committee of the same next we want 
to talk about leadership so what i would say here

0:38:00.720,0:38:05.520
is that leadership is not limited to being the 
president of a club or an organization certainly

0:38:05.520,0:38:10.160
that's one way to demonstrate leadership but we 
want to be thinking beyond that right professional

0:38:10.160,0:38:14.640
schools are looking for people that can take 
initiative that have go-getter attitudes that can

0:38:14.640,0:38:19.040
work with other people even through challenging 
situations that have grit that have resilience

0:38:19.040,0:38:24.480
leadership roles and leadership experiences can 
help you to gain those things so leadership could

0:38:24.480,0:38:27.840
mean training other people it could mean 
tutoring it could mean being a ta it could

0:38:27.840,0:38:32.240
mean being a mentor or a role model to others it 
could mean taking initiative towards a cause that

0:38:32.240,0:38:37.600
you care about all perfectly valid ways to gain 
leadership but we want to be thinking about that

0:38:37.600,0:38:41.440
you want to be thinking about service if you're 
going into a health profession you're going into a

0:38:41.440,0:38:46.080
service oriented profession so you need to have a 
heart for serving others around you and admissions

0:38:46.080,0:38:51.120
committees expect to see that so we're looking 
for service that is both regular and sustained

0:38:51.120,0:38:55.120
regular meaning you do it every week or every 
other week or once a month you don't do it once a

0:38:55.120,0:39:00.240
year and call it done sustained meaning you don't 
do it for two months and stop right you continue

0:39:00.240,0:39:04.880
doing this because you're passionate about it and 
you care about it and recognize that some programs

0:39:04.880,0:39:09.200
specifically define community service is working 
with the disadvantaged population of people so you

0:39:09.200,0:39:13.200
want to be mindful of that and then there's the 
other stuff right research if you're excited about

0:39:13.200,0:39:17.760
it the hobbies the extracurriculars so once you 
get engaged you want to maintain your involvement

0:39:18.480,0:39:22.560
this is so that you can be building 
competencies through doing these experiences

0:39:22.560,0:39:26.320
and i would strongly encourage you to 
journal about these experiences so that

0:39:26.320,0:39:30.720
you can remember these stories so when it comes 
time to interview or write a personal statement

0:39:30.720,0:39:34.320
you'll be ready to go it's really important to 
make meaning out of the things that you've done

0:39:35.040,0:39:40.480
so as you get a little bit closer to applying 
you want to start making a list of schools and

0:39:40.480,0:39:44.880
visiting schools that you might be interested 
in how long that list is going to be varies

0:39:44.880,0:39:49.280
from profession to profession but for those of you 
for example that are pre-med we usually recommend

0:39:49.280,0:39:53.280
that students apply to 15 to 20 schools so it's 
a pretty hefty list when all is said and done

0:39:54.320,0:40:00.000
next you want to be prepping for your admissions 
exams the gre for example looks very different

0:40:00.000,0:40:04.880
than the mcat so you need to know what admissions 
exam you're expected to take for your health

0:40:04.880,0:40:09.280
profession of interest and then you need to do 
some research on how long you should expect to

0:40:09.280,0:40:13.920
study for that exam and how you should expect 
to study for that exam because like i said the

0:40:13.920,0:40:19.040
gre and mcat very different tests very different 
timelines for studying and a very different study

0:40:19.040,0:40:23.520
process for those exams so come talk to hpa 
if you have questions we can help you on that

0:40:24.320,0:40:29.120
okay so after that recognize that many 
programs strongly encourage what we

0:40:29.120,0:40:34.720
call a committee letter of evaluation so health 
professions advising offers something called the

0:40:34.720,0:40:39.520
health professions evaluation committee or hpec 
for sure for short which provides you with this

0:40:39.520,0:40:44.800
committee letter of evaluation think about this 
as kind of like a rec letter but in a rec letter

0:40:44.800,0:40:48.880
the person that's writing it typically knows 
you really well but in a limited scope right

0:40:48.880,0:40:53.360
it might be a faculty member that you took a class 
with so they know your performance in that class

0:40:53.360,0:40:56.960
and that you came to office hours every 
week and you were a highly engaged student

0:40:56.960,0:41:01.280
in contrast the person that writes this committee 
letter doesn't necessarily know you well

0:41:01.280,0:41:05.120
but they know the pool of applicants 
that tend to apply to health professions

0:41:05.120,0:41:09.920
and so through you putting together a packet of 
information and interviewing with that individual

0:41:09.920,0:41:15.360
they can have a really good idea of how your 
strengths line up with that pool of applicants and

0:41:15.360,0:41:22.560
they can write this macro scale perspective letter 
for you as an applicant and then of course apply

0:41:22.560,0:41:27.920
remembering that this is a year-long process 
typically so for a student that is not wanting to
